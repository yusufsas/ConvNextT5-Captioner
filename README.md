# ConvNextT5-Captioner
This repository presents an image captioning framework leveraging ConvNeXtV2 Base as the visual encoder and T5-base as the autoregressive text decoder. The architecture integrates a powerful convolutional backbone for high-quality visual feature extraction with a transformer-based language model for sequence generation.
